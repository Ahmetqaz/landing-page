HyzyrWould you please make these final changes:
+ 1. on navigation menu Writings is misspelled - should be spelled Writings w/ one “t”. It is spelled correctly on my template
+ 2. Please delete text for 14 web pg Cain About and insert new corrected text found at psd file: 14 web pg Cain About v6.psd
+ 3. 3mobile isle scrolling column images load slowly and i know the image files are too big. Can you please reduce the scroller image sizes so they load faster
4. some friends browsing ddcain.com website website saw “not secure website” message. I didn’t see it. Please check
5. Please check for any website error messages listed on Host server and correct
6. After all corrections are uploaded to Inmotion host server please put into Dropbox file copies of all files uploade to host server so I can keep a copy offline. This was stated as a requirement in my Notes at the beginning
Thank you
Doug
